# Conways Game of Life (in TIC-80)

Just a quick and messy implementation of conway's game of life. Initial pattern is random.

First version ran at only 3 frames as second but after optimisation and removing interactive features this now runs at 35-ish. Might be interesting to re-make it and keep some interactive stuff.
